# 📜 Text Summarizer Using NLTK

This project implements a **text summarization tool** using Python's NLTK library. The tool extracts the most important sentences from a given text based on word frequencies, making it an efficient and straightforward summarization solution. 🚀

---

## ✨ Features

- **Text Tokenization** 📝: Breaks the text into sentences and words.
- **Stopword Removal** ❌: Filters out common words like "the," "is," "and," etc.
- **Word Frequency Analysis** 📊: Identifies and ranks words based on their importance in the text.
- **Sentence Scoring** ⭐: Scores sentences based on the presence of high-frequency words.
- **Summary Generation** 📋: Outputs the top `n` sentences as a concise summary.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍: Core programming language.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Input**: Provide a block of text.
2. **Tokenization**: The text is split into sentences and words.
3. **Stopword Filtering**: Common words are removed to focus on meaningful terms.
4. **Frequency Analysis**: Calculates word frequencies to determine importance.
5. **Sentence Scoring**: Scores sentences based on word frequencies.
6. **Output**: Returns the most relevant sentences as the summary.

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tanish141/TextSummarizerUsingNLTK.git
   cd TextSummarizerUsingNLTK
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install nltk
   ```

4. **Download NLTK Data**:
   Run the following commands in Python to download required NLTK packages:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```

5. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python TextSummarizerUsingNLTK.py
   ```

## 🖥️ Example Usage

### Input:
```plaintext
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind, such as learning and problem-solving.
```

### Output:
```plaintext
Summary:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind, such as learning and problem-solving.
